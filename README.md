# Jose Lara-Ceja

## I am a junior developer that is currently in the TripleTen program and have been coding for about 4 months & have created 3 independent webpages.
## I have the knowledge and know how to create websites from scratch i've learned *HTML* , *CSS* ,  *Javascript*, *Vscode*, *Gitbash*, & *Github* all the needed basics.
## I hope to work on projects with a team and enter the starting field as an apprentice and learn while i create and maintain company or client websites.
## If you have the time i would really appreciate if you can go into more detail about javascript with me so i have it 100% hands down.
## You can ask me about what i code in my free time or what i learned while in the TripleTen bootcamp also ask about my other hobbies if you want to get to know me more.
