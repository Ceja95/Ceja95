Jose Lara-Ceja
Aspiring Front-End Developer  TripleTen Bootcamp Student
Iâ€™m a passionate junior developer currently enrolled in the TripleTen Software Engineering program, with one year of hands-on coding experience. I specialize in building websites from scratch using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I'm comfortable with development tools such as VS Code, Git, GitHub, and Git Bash, and I understand version control and modern web development workflows.
Iâ€™m eager to contribute to real-world projects in a collaborative team environment, where I can continue learning while helping develop and maintain websites that serve real user needs. My curiosity drives me to explore new coding patterns and best practicesâ€”even in my free time, I enjoy experimenting with code and learning new skills.
If youâ€™re curious about my personal projects or want to hear more about my bootcamp experience, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™m also happy to share a bit about my other creative interests beyond coding.
